# Welcome!

This is the first post I'm making on this blog!

Initially when I thought of creating a blog, I was thinking of building everything from the ground up. But thankfully tools like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) exist, so I don't have to go through that trouble.

I will be using this blog primarily as an outlet for me to write about things related to programming. Don't expect any frequent posts though.
